CMD MODULE

The cmd module provides a class called Cmd that simplifies the process of creating command-line interfaces. By subclassing Cmd and defining methods with a specific naming convention, you can create a custom command interpreter.
 HOW TO START CMD 
Import the Module:
First, you need to import the cmd module in your Python script.

import cmd
Create a Subclass of Cmd:
Define a new class that inherits from cmd.Cmd. This class will represent your command-line interpreter.

Define Command Methods:
Methods that handle commands should start with do_ followed by the command name. For example, to create a command called greet, define a method do_greet.

Run the Command Loop:
Create an instance of your subclass and call the cmdloop method to start the command interpreter.
